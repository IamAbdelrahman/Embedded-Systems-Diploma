# Microcontroller Communication Protocol Course:

## SPI

### Assignment1: 
	- MCU receives data from a terminal and sends it back using UART, and sends it to a SPI
	peripheral too using the BluePill development board, then watch the output on the oscillscope.


### Assignment2: 
	- MCU receives data from a terminal and sends it back using UART, and sends it to another MCU 
	using SPI, and then this MCU receives that data to send it to a terminal using UART.
