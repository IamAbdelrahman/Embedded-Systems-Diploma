# Microcontroller Communication Protocol Course:

## USART

### Assignment1: 
	- Using the BluePill development board and a virtual terminal to send/receive 
	data by using the polling mechanism.


### Assignment2: 
	- Using the BluePill development board and a virtual terminal to send/receive 
	data by using the interrupt mechanism.


### Assignment3: 
	- Using the ATmega32 MCU and a virtual terminal to send/receive 
	data by using the polling mechanism.


### Assignment4: 
	- Using the ATmega32 MCU and a virtual terminal to send/receive 
	data by using the interrupt mechanism.


### Lab1:
	- Using the ATmega32 to receive data from a virtual terminal then send it to the LCD
	by using the polling mechanism.


### Lab2:
	- Using the ATmega32 to send/receive numbers and strings 
	by using the polling mechanism.

### Lab3:
	- Using the ATmega32 to send strings asynchronoulsy to the LCD as it also counts from 1 to 10.

### Lab4:
	- Using the ATmega32 to receive strings asycnronously from the terminal, and the MCU sends them
	to be displayed on the LCD.
