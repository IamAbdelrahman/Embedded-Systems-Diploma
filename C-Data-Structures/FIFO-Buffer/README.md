## Queue-Array Based

# The Queue here is a finite sequence of elements with following operations:-
# Initialize the Queue >> leaving the Queue empty.
# Determine if the Queue is full/empty or not.
# Find the Queue size.
# Append a new entry at the rear of the Queue >> provided if the Queue is not full.
# Retrieve the front entry from the Queue >> provided if the Queue is not empty.
# Serve or remove the front entry from the Queue >> provided if the Queue is not empty.
# Traverse (display) the Queue >> visited each entry of the Queue.
# Clear the Queue >> leaving it empty.

# Note that here the Queue gets full even the memory is not.
# All elements are reserved even the Queue is empty (Wasting Memory).
