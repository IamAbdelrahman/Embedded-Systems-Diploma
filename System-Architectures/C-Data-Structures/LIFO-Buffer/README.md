# Stack-Array Based

## The Stack here is a finite sequence of elements with following operations:-
## Initialize the stack >> leaving the stack empty.
## Determine if the stack is full/empty or not.
## Find the stack size.
## Push a new element at the top of the stack >> provided if the stack is not full.
## Pop an element from the top of the stack >> provided if the stack is not empty.
## Retrieve (copy) the top entry of the stack. 
## Traverse (display) the stack >> visited each element of the stack.
## Clear the stack >> leaving it empty.

## Note that here the stack gets full even the memory is not.
## All elements are reserved even the stack is empty (Wasting Memory).
