# Microcontroller Architectures Course:

## Lab1-4 : 
- Write 1 on pit 16 on ODR register using different methods.

## Lab5 :
- Watch the effect of enabling/disabling the clock source of the GPIO.

## Lab6 :
- Configure the Stm32-board to run on the following rates:-
	APB1 Bus frequency 4MHZ
	APB2 Bus frequency 2MHZ
	AHB frequency 8 MHZ
	SysClk 8 MHZ
	Using only internal HSI_RC.

## Lab7 :
- Configure the Stm32-board to run on the following rates:-
	APB1 Bus frequency 16MHZ
	APB2 Bus frequency 8MHZ
	AHB frequency 32 MHZ
	SysClk 32 MHZ
	Using only internal HSI_RC.

## Lab8 :
- Enable External Interrupt "EXT0" in Stm32.

## Lab9 :
- Enable INT0 in ATmega32, to toggle a led connected to it.

## Lab10 :
- Enable INT0, INT1, and INT2 in ATmega32, to control three leds connected to it.
